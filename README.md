# Pokémon Team Builder

I'm very fond of Pokémon based APIs not only because they relate to one of my favorite games growing up (well, one of my favorite games now as an adult as well!), but because they're often free and well maintained! It also enables me to develop projects that I would use in my personal time.

Here, I'm diving into TypeScript by building an app that allows a user to build a team and quickly find weaknesses within their team so they can best create a competitive roster.

The application will include a "fuzzy search" of sorts, async/await, and a clean UI. This project is built on React and will leverage the Context API.
